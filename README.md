This is a sleek, dark-themed contact form website built with HTML, CSS, JS, and integrated with [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) for backend-free form submissions. The site includes a styled submission form, a custom thank-you page, and responsive layout optimized for deployment (e.g., Netlify).

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive design
- Dark theme UI
- Styled input fields with hover and focus states
- Powered by [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co)
- Redirects to a custom thank-you page after form submission
- Organized structure ready for deployment

## 🧱 Built With

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
- **CSS3** — Custom styling with CSS variables
- **JS** - Sidebar, testimonials modal, custom select filtering, form validation, and page navigation.
- **FormSubmit** — Email form backend without server code

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User fills out the contact form.
2. FormSubmit processes and sends the submission to the configured email.
3. On success, user is redirected to `thank-you.html`.
