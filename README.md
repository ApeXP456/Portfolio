## 💡 Deployment

This site is Netlify-ready. 
Visit the Website here:
https://jarodcunningham.netlify.app/

This is a sleek, personal website built with HTML, CSS, JS, and integrated with a contact form [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) for form submissions. 
The site includes a custom thank-you page, and responsive layout optimized for deployment (e.g., Netlify).

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive design
- Styled input fields with hover and focus states
- Redirects to a custom thank-you page after contact form submission

## 🧱 Built With

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
- **CSS3** — Custom styling with CSS variables
- **JS** - Sidebar, testimonials modal, custom select filtering, form validation, and page navigation.
- **FormSubmit** — Email form

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User fills out the contact form.
2. FormSubmit processes and sends the submission to the configured email.
3. On success, user is redirected to `thank-you.html`.

**Note:** FormSubmit requires your email to be verified via a confirmation link the first time you receive submissions.
